# Simple Student Query Engine

Built to solve:
```
Given a list of test results (each with a test date, Student ID, and the studentÂ¹s Score) from an external data source, return the Final Score for each student for a user-provided date range. A student's Final Score is calculated as the average of his/her 5 highest test scores. You can assume each student has at least 5 test scores.
```

Notes:
* For an example implementation, I decided the "external data source" would be a file.
  * Obviously this could easily be a REST/SOAP API, DB, binary dump, etc...
* I also chose a cmd-line interface over a REST or similar.

```
Usage: main.rb [options]
    -f, --file FILE                  File containing student data
    -i, --id STUDENT                 Student ID
    -s, --start [TIME]               Start Timestamp, e.g. 1409258913
    -e, --end [TIME]                 End Timestamp, e.g. 1409258913
```

==== Interview Requirements ====

* Works?
  * You should be able to test that it works by providing a text file with sample data
and then querying the program via the command line.
  * E.g., 'ruby main.rb -f sampledata.txt -i 0002 -s 1409258913 -e 1409258914'

* Tested?
  * A series of small unit and functional tests exercise the code
  * Run them with 'ruby tests.rb'

* Well designed?
  * Designed using the strategy pattern to allow external sources to be swapped out, e.g. REST API instead of the File loader.
  * Assumption was that there was a max number of students that would fit into memory
  * Number of highest grades to average is mutable by just specifying an optional parameter.
  * Score dates are stored as timestamps which simplifies a lot of things, and if needed can be converted back to human-readable for display purposes.

* Code readability?
  * Code is short thanks to Ruby's duck and dynamic typing.

* Extendible and maintainable?
  * Should be able to swap out various external sources easily without modifying core code.
  * Code was written to be readable rather than optimized.
  * Should be no problem to put different interfaces on top of this code, e.g. REST interface.
  * Number of highest grades is not hardcoded, but does default to 5.
